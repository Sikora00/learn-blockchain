# Documentation

This folder contains learning notes, session summaries, and detailed explorations of blockchain concepts discovered during the project.

## Structure

### `ai-sessions/`

Records of significant AI-assisted learning sessions, including:

- Key questions asked and answered
- Technical decisions made
- Code patterns that worked well
- Learning outcomes and follow-up topics
- References to specific code sections explored

Each session file follows the naming pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD-session-topic.md`

### Future planned folders:

- `concepts/` - Deep dives into specific blockchain concepts
- `experiments/` - Notes from code experiments and mini-projects
- `resources/` - Curated links and external resources

## Purpose

The goal is to track the learning journey from blockchain basics through Bitcoin fundamentals to Ethereum smart contracts, with AI as a pair programming partner.

Each session document serves as:

1. **Learning checkpoint** - What was understood at that point
2. **Decision log** - Why certain approaches were chosen
3. **Knowledge base** - Quick reference for concepts learned
4. **Debugging aid** - Record of what worked and what didn't

## Usage

Before starting a new learning session, review recent session docs to:

- Avoid re-exploring the same topics
- Build on previous insights
- Identify gaps that need follow-up

After each significant session, create a new session document capturing the key learnings and decisions made.
